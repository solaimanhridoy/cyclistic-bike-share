The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data\nvisualizations.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Characters and teams\n\n● **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself\napart by also oﬀering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with\ndisabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about\n8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to\ncommute to work each day.\n\n● **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns\nand initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n\n● **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and\nreporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy\nlearning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic\nachieve them.\n\n● **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the\nrecommended marketing program.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About the company\n\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the ﬂexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nCyclistic’s ﬁnance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more proﬁtable than casual riders. Although the pricing ﬂexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders diﬀer, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aﬀect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Ask \n\nMoreno has assigned me the ﬁrst question to answer from the three questions which will guide the future marketing program: \n\n* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently?\n\nThe goal of Cyclistic Bike-Share is to increase yearly memberships by turning casual customers (single-ride and day passes) into members (annual membership).
